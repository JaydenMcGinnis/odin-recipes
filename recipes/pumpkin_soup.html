        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol style="list-style: none; padding: 0">
            <li>
                <b>Step 1:</b>
                <p>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add onion and cook, 
                stirring occasionally, until onion is browned and softened, about 10 minutes. 
                Add peppercorns, garlic, and thyme, and cook, stirring often, until fragrant 
                and slightly browned, about 2 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Step 2:</b>
                <p>Stir in pumpkin puree; cook, stirring occasionally, until puree turns a 
                few shades darker, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken stock, maple syrup, salt,
                nutmeg, and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer over medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, 
                and stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and flavors meld, about 30 
                minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Step 3:</b>
                <p> Transfer soup to a blender in batches; secure lid on blender and remove 
                center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening; 
                blend until smooth, about 30 seconds per batch. Return soup to the pot 
                and stir in heavy cream. Cook over medium until heated through, about 4 minutes.</p>
